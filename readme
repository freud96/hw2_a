first clone the code from github
second make sure python3, C++ are installed and updated

dudring execution, connect your STM32 with your breardboard such that the three buttons are connected to 3 DAC pins(D10,D11, D12), the analog output is D7 and analog input is A0.

connect A0 with AWG from pico, and D7 to A. 

I used 4 different frequecies
I noticed that the higher the frequency, the more difficult it is to reach a peak of 3V at the RC low pass filter output. The reason is the charging time of the capacity is slower than the rise time of the dac output waveform.

As for the sampling part, I could not really catch a more reasonable output as I was supposed to. Maybe the sampling frequency was not large enough, hence less data was stored.
